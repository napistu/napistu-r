}
\arguments{
\item{species_id}{species identifier for focal node}

\item{consensus_model}{network reconstruction}

\item{consensus_graph}{igraph model of network}

\item{precomputed_distances}{A table of precomputed distances between pairs of
molecular species. Or, NULL to calculate this on-the-fly (default).}

\item{network_type}{what type of neighborhood should be formed (ignored
if \code{consensus_graph} is undirected).
\describe{
  \item{downstream}{descendants of the focal node}
  \item{upstream}{ancestors of the focal node}
  \item{hourglass}{descendants and ancestors of focal node}
}}

\item{max_steps}{number of steps away from focal node allowed}

\item{max_neighbors}{prune to this number of upstream regulators and
downstream targets}

\item{cpr}{binding to cpr python library}
