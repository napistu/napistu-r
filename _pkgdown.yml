- title: Using Napistu Python Functionality from R
  desc: These functions include Shiny modules and other pretty plotting functions
    which are used for visualizing Napistu's network information either statically or
    dynamically.
    
- title: Initialization
  desc: Configure a `napistu_list` object containing a database and network-based
    representation of a pathway and bindings to the Napistu Python package.
  contents:

    - load_napistu_config
  - subtitle: Assets
    desc: loading the core Napistu objects - an `sbml_dfs`, `napistu_graph`,
      `species_identifiers` and optionally, `precomputed_distances`

- title: R-Based Functionality Supporting Napistu Pathway Transformations
  desc: These functions are used to pull data and metadata into the Napistu framework.
    Many of these functions are accessed through the rpy2 module of the Napistu Python
    package or through its CLI. With time hopefully some or all of these R calls from
    Python can be replaced with pure Python.

  - subtitle: Gene Metadata
    desc: Many of the functions in Napistu depend on genic metadata which is currently pulled
      from specialized species-level Bioconductor packages.
