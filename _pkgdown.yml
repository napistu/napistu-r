- title: Using CPR Python Functionality from R
  desc: These functions include Shiny modules and other pretty plotting functions
    which are used for visualizing CPR's network information either statically or
    dynamically.

- title: R-Based Functionality Supporting CPR Pathway Transformations
  desc: These functions are used to pull data and metadata into the CPR framework.
    Many of these functions are accessed through the rpy2 module of the CPR Python
    package or through its CLI. With time hopefully some or all of these R calls from
    Python can be replaced with pure Python.
- subtitle: Gene Metadata
  desc: Many of the functions in CPR depend on genic metadata which is currently pulled
    from specialized species-level Bioconductor packages.

    or other functional information.
